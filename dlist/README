dlist: singly-linked list

The dlist structure is a doubly-linked list based on the dlist_node structure.
An dlist_node has three fields:

        struct dlist_node {
        	 void			*entry;
        	 size_t			 size;
        	 struct dlist_node	*prev;
        	 struct dlist_node	*next;
        };

All that is required for a list is to use an

        struct dlist_node	*head;

An empty list is signified by a node with a value of NULL.

The man page contains documentation on the API.
