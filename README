data structures in C

After another re-reading of "Programming Wisdom", I was struck by the quote

> The following data structures are a complete list for almost all practical
> programs:
>     array
>     linked list
>     hash table
>     binary tree

In order to progress in my path to being a more competent developer, I've
decided to work on implementing these data structures in C. This may even
be a semi-annual tradition, to always go back to my roots. The more familiar
I become with these data structures, the faster this should be. In essence,
this is something of a kata, a programming drill that helps me to focus my
thoughts on other problems.
